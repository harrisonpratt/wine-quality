## Exploratory Data Analysis in R

---

### 1) Business Understanding

When determining if a wine is considered high-quality, there are certain attributes that good wines often have. One of these is **acidity** ‚Äî a medium amount can add freshness and structure, while too much or too little can unbalance a wine. 

Another factor is **pH**. A pH that is too low or too high can negatively impact the taste, making the wine lower-quality.  

Finally, **residual sugar** also plays a critical role. Too much or too little can create imbalanced flavors.  

Having a balance between these attributes helps create a **balanced wine with complexity**, which are hallmarks of high-quality wine.

### 3) Data Preparation

The data was downloaded from the [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).

The ZIP file included:
- `winequality-red.csv`: Red wine data
- `winequality-white.csv`: White wine data
- `winequality.names`: Metadata and citation info

I merged and labeled the datasets with a `color` column to distinguish between red and white wines.

### 4) Modeling + Evaluating (Exploratory Data Analysis)

We investigated the following hypotheses based on wine chemistry and expert knowledge.

#### Hypotheses:

- **Acidity Hypothesis (Fixed Acidity)**  
  - H‚ÇÄ: No significant relationship between fixed acidity and wine quality  
  - H‚ÇÅ: Moderate fixed acidity improves wine quality

- **pH Hypothesis**  
  - H‚ÇÄ: No significant relationship between pH and wine quality  
  - H‚ÇÅ: Moderate pH levels improve wine quality

- **Residual Sugar Hypothesis**  
  - H‚ÇÄ: No significant relationship between residual sugar and wine quality  
  - H‚ÇÅ: Balanced residual sugar improves wine quality

### Conclusion

This analysis explored how **acidity**, **pH**, and **residual sugar** relate to wine quality in both red and white wines.

- For **white wines**, acidity and sugar both had a small **negative** impact on quality, while a balanced pH had a **positive** impact.
- For **red wines**, fixed acidity showed a **positive** effect, lower pH slightly improved quality, and residual sugar had **no impact**.

These findings align with expert insights: balance is crucial. Although statistically significant, the **correlations were weak**, suggesting **other factors and personal taste play a large role** in wine quality evaluation.
